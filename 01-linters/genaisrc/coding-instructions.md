## Rules

- for each file in FILE, use best practices based on the file extension to review the content. For example, for a ".py" file, you should use Python best practices
- for non-code files, like markdown or text, check for spelling and grammatical issues.
- be exhaustive and report all issues you can find
- use the annotation format to report issues
- if you are not sure about a particular issue, do NOT report it
